# Project

`Introduction`: This is my first repository on GitHub. A simple web application that allows users to search for and view information about movies or books could be implemented using a variety of programming languages, depending on the specific requirements of the project and your own personal preferences. Some popular choices for building web applications include: 

- `JavaScript`, using a framework such as React or AngularJS for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.

- `Python`, using a web framework such as Flask or Django for the back-end and JavaScript for the front-end.

- `Ruby`, using a web framework such as Ruby on Rails for the back-end and JavaScript for the front-end.

- `Java`, using a web framework such as Spring or Play for the back-end and JavaScript for the front-end.

It's important to consider the specific requirements of the project, such as performance and scalability, as well as your own experience and comfort level with the language before making a decision.

`Steps`: Here are the general steps you can take to begin a Java web application project on GitHub:

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.

2. Create a new repository for your project by clicking the "New" button on the GitHub homepage. Give it a name and a brief description, and make sure to check the "Initialize this repository with a README" option.

3. Clone the repository to your local machine using the "Clone or download" button on the repository's GitHub page. You can use the HTTPS or SSH link, depending on your setup.

4. Install the necessary software to develop Java web applications, such as the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

5. Create a new project in your IDE using the appropriate template for a Java web application.

6. Configure the project to use a web framework such as Spring or Play.

7. Start coding your web application, making sure to commit your changes to the local repository regularly.

8. Push your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub when you are ready to share your code with others or when you want to save your progress.

It's a good idea to also create a .gitignore file to ignore files that are specific to your local environment, such as target folders or IDE specific files. And also to create a README file to explain what your project does and how to use it.

`Java`: 

* To create a simple web application that allows users to search for and view information about movies or books, you may need to add the following classes:

- A class that represents the movie or book (e.g. Movie.java or Book.java)
- A class that handles the database operations (e.g. MovieRepository.java or BookRepository.java)
- A class that handles the business logic for the application (e.g. MovieService.java or BookService.java)
- A class that handles the web request and response (e.g. MovieController.java or BookController.java)
- You might also need to add classes to handle exceptions, security, and other functionality depending on the requirements of your application.
