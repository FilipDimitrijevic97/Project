# Project

`Introduction`: This is my first repository on GitHub. A simple web application that allows users to search for and view information about movies or books could be implemented using a variety of programming languages, depending on the specific requirements of the project and your own personal preferences. Some popular choices for building web applications include: 

- `JavaScript`, using a framework such as React or AngularJS for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.

- `Python`, using a web framework such as Flask or Django for the back-end and JavaScript for the front-end.

- `Ruby`, using a web framework such as Ruby on Rails for the back-end and JavaScript for the front-end.

- `Java`, using a web framework such as Spring or Play for the back-end and JavaScript for the front-end.

It's important to consider the specific requirements of the project, such as performance and scalability, as well as your own experience and comfort level with the language before making a decision.
